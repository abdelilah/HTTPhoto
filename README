INSTALLATION

- Copy "iphone_photo" directory to a webserver, ideally you have a local webserver and you would copy that under your document root.
- Optionally you may want to edit HTTPhoto/Classes/HTTPhotoViewController.m and set the correct path to the upload script.
- Open HTTPhoto/HTTPhoto.xcodeproj and build the app
